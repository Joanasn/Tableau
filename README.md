Project Description: DVD rentals. 
The DVD rental store wants to use the data to know about their customers, their preferences and 
movements. Having this specific infomation will help the store evaluate about prices, reach to clients
for specific questions or sales and mainly, know if the strategy they are using so far is working. 
I will be stating situations as a dvd rental company, from looking up customers, inventory, costs, etc.
